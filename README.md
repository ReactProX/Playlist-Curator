# Playlist-Curator

5/10
ui is mostly done, still need to figure out how the side nave bar works and clean up some of the layout. I created on onclick for the addBtn but feel free to rework that as needed

@Matt your data comes from $("#newSub") and $("#timeframe")
@Nick once the playlist is generated append an $("<iframe>") with src="//www.youtube.com/embed/" to $("#video")

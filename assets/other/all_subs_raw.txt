Note to moderators
Subreddits must be older than one month to be added to this list. If your subreddit is still new, you should follow these steps:

Raerth's guide to starting a new subreddit will help you get started.
Make sure your subreddit has regular daily submissions, even if they are from the mods.
Edit your sidebar to tell visitors what your subreddit is for.
Make yourself a post in /r/Music promoting it.
Announce your subreddit in /r/NewReddits and /r/ShamelessPlug.
If and only if your subreddit is ALREADY active (more than one month, and lots of links and users), send a modmail to the /r/Music moderation team.
There is a private subreddit for music moderators called /r/MusicMods. This is a place to report spammers as well as enable communication and cross-promotion between all the subreddits. Check it.
